## FAQ

#### What inspired you to make this?

This was my first application made in Java using a GUI for a school project. Now that I'm on break I was hoping to use my newly acquired knowledge to make this into a real game.

#### What is your road map for this project?

Mainly I've worked on just refactoring my old code, when thats done I plan to work down this list of features:
- Adding an AI opponent for the player to play against.
- Creating a server and client application so that multiplayer between two systems is possible.
- Working on the GUI in order to make it more up to date and not look terrible.

#### How long do you plan to work on this?

I'll be working on this whenever I have the time. Most likely it will be done in a few weeks to a maximum of a month.

#### What are you planning to work on next?

My plan is to start working on the client/server of this application, mostly because I want to show it off to my family.
## AI Explained

At This point in development the AI is very simple. It will only check for potential wins and losses, if none are found it picks a random location on the board to place a piece. I might change this later to be more advanced using the minimax algorithm and heuristics.
