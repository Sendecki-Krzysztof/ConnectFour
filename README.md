## FAQ

#### What inspired you to make this?

This was my first application made in Java using a GUI for a school project. Now that I'm on break I was hoping to use my newly acquired knowledge to make this into a real game.

#### What are some of your planned features?

So far I'm mainly working on refactoring my old code. When thats done I hope to add and AI to play against, make the graphical interface look better, and finally creating a simple client and server for this to run in depending on if I have the time.

#### How long do you plan to work on this?

I'll be working on this whenever I have the time. Most likely it will be done in a month.
